It's the fourth homework of Natural Language Processing course in Spring 2024 at Sharif University of Technology. It's about collecting a dataset about gender neutralize. Then we perform LoRA fine-tuning on Llama 3.

The dataset is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmirMohammadFakhimi/gender_neutralize/settings).

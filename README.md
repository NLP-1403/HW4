It's the fourth homework of the Natural Language Processing course in Spring 2024 at Sharif University of Technology. It's about collecting a dataset about gender neutralization. Then we perform LoRA fine-tuning on Llama 3. Finally, we achieved state-of-the-art results in gender neutralization for the Persian language.

The dataset is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AmirMohammadFakhimi/gender_neutralize).
